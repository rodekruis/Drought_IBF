# Drought Analysis
The scripts presented in this repository are developed as part of a MSc Thesis "Assessing the forecast skill of agricultural drought forecsat from satellite-derived products in the Lower SHire River Basin". As mentioned in the script the first part creating a mask layer is written by Dr. ir. H.C. Winsemius (TU Delft). 

The second script is written in collaboration with Gabriela Guimaraes Nobre (VU Amsterdam)

## Time serie analysis
The script include: 

1. Extracting CHIRPS and SPEI data over a masked layer (shapefile imported from QGIS)
2. Correlation matrix
3. Calculating Standardised Anomalies
4. Making Climatologies
5. Calculating dry spells based on daily precipitation data
6. Extra reminders of script: 
   example: how to remove specific values from a NETCDF file and making boxplots.
